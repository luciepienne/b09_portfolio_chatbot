## Overview
As a trainee in Simplon, I had to make a html portfolio (js included).
I have introduced a chat asistant who has been trained on my resume and who is able to answer to any question asked.
Adapted portfolio with CV and updated datas on author. (option chatbot)

## How to Run
Make sure you have created a file key.py and enter your key as such 
my_key = "'your_key'"

Run the file : api_chat.py
in another terminal, where you have your index.html file,  run this : python -m http.server 8001

The brwoser will start and the chatbot will run as well
- run in python 3.11
- Ensure you have pip install beautifullsoup4

## Different interesting points
- Need to make sure your key is working in EDENAI
- Need to work a bit deeper on the chat bot box which can be annoying
- not for the project but the file edenai_chat.py is keeping the historics of a chat. To be used in case of need.

## Notes

this is a personal work near from reality.

```
## Usage

internal usage only. for training only
